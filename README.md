# TensorFlow_V2_Example_tf.keras
TensorFlow_V2 Example tf.keras - Python Code - PyCharm

This example is adotded form the original TensorFlow2 example here. 
https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
It runs in Python3 using GPU computing with CUDA10.0 and CuDNN. 
The original example runs well in colab
https://colab.research.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0rc/site/en/r2/tutorials/keras/basic_classification.ipynb
but gave several errors in standalone Pyton and TensorFlow2RC0 wich I have fixed in this version.
